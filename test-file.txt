BLANCHE:  Don't tell him those things; he'll believe it.                        
STELLA:  No--not at my place. My mother's still sick!                           
BLANCHE:  One-eyed jacks are wild.                                              
STELLA:  You, Blanche?  Blanche?  Blanche? Stanley?                             
BLANCHE:  I'm out                                                               
STELLA:  One.                                                                   
BLANCHE:  Anyone want a shot?                                                   
STELLA:  Why don't somebody go to the Chinaman's and bring back a load of chop suey?                                                                            
BLANCHE:  Kind of on your high horse, ain't you?                                
BLANCHE:  I'm out again. I oughta go home pretty soon.
